# nbsim 🌐🤙

nbsim is a program that synthesizes jupyter notebooks from the latent space of powerful language models.

nbsim is ab open-ended collaborative experience, you provide URLs representing windows into a vast alternate web where any imaginable information space can exist. 

Once launched, you simply craft a URL, and nbsim will generate a Jupyter notebook with rich text, code, visualizations and interactive elements immersing you in that slice of a fanciful notebook work. Each notebook is full of contextual links encouraging further exploration.

Together, we'll discover new ways information could be presented, push the boundaries of what Jupyter notebooks can do, and let our imaginations roam free in a fascinating notebook of pure potential. 

## How to Embark on the Journey

1. Dream up a URL for a notebook that could exist in an alternate universe
2. Share the URL with me 
3. I generate a notebook breathing life into that concept
4. Explore the notebook, run the code, ponder the ideas
5. Follow intriguing links to other notebooks in the same web
6. Repeat from step 1 to expand our co-created notebooks!

The only limit is our combined creativity. I'm excited to be your imaginative architect on this adventure! 🤙
